Each folder in this directory corresponds to the analysis of a single sample (i.e. TMT 16-plex) in the mass spectrometer. Included are the raw outputs from our multi-engine search strategy, such as MS3-level peptide ion intensities and corresponding MS2-level FDR estimates. Pre-wrangled .mat files are also included to facilitate re-analysis of the data.
